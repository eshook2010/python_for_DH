# Python for Digital Humanities

Materials from the Python for Digital Humanities Workshop taught on December 13, 2021 for the Boise State University Digital Humanities Group. This 3-hour workshop was created to provide both a very brief introduction to the various capabilities of Python and a small lesson in using Python to pull meaningul insight out of text files.  

Two files are included:
- [ ] Lesson.md: This provides the pre-work necessary and a thorough outline of the workshop with code snippets.
- [ ] owyhee-canyonlands-wilderness-B.txt: An OCR'd file from the Boise State University Special Collections and Archives used to facilitate a demonstration of working with text files in Python. 

For questions about this lesson, reach out to [Elisabeth Shook](mailto:elisabethshook@boisestate.edu).
