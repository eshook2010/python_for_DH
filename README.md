# Python for Digital Humanities

Materials from the Python for Digital Humanities Workshop taught on December 13, 2021 for the Boise State University Digital Humanities Group. This workshop was created to provide both a very brief introduction to the various capabilities of Python and a small lesson in using Python to pull meaningul insight out of text files.
