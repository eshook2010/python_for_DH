CHAPTER VI
COORDINATION, CONSISTENCY, AND PUBLIC PARTICIPATION

A, COORDINATION AND CONSULTATION

Coordination and consultation has been a continuing process
beginning in 1978 with the initial wilderness inventory of BLM lands.
The issue identification and alternative formulation' process for this
EIS involved individual contacts with federal, state and local
government agencies, organizations or interest groups, and individuals
affected by the proposed action, Approximately 700 informational
packets were mailed out to solicit comments. The scoping
process for the EIS is outlined in Chapter I.

B, CONSISTENCY

The proposed Owyhee Canyonlands Wilderness is consistent with
the General Plan for Elko County, Nevada (June, 1971) and the Malheur
County, Oregon Comprehensive Plan (1983). The Owyhee County, idaho
Comprehensive Plan Update (1980) does not address wilderness
recommendations.

The management objectives of the Owyhee Canyonlands Wilderness
are consistent with wildlife management objectives identified by
state wildlife management agencies in Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada.

C. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
1. Preparation of Draft EIS
Each of the three districts involved prepared a Wilderness
Study Public Participation Plan to continue the public review
process begun during the wilderness inventory. The district
plans coordinate all wilderness studies to maintain consistency
between issue identification and the BLM Wilderness Study
Policy.

The government agencies, elected officials, and interest
groups that participated in the EIS process by providing input
during the scoping phase for the Draft EIS are listed below.

composition of an area.

Cherry Stem Road -A road that penetrate the interior of a WSA but does not
divide it into two separate areas.

Ecological Condition -The present state of vegetation in an area in
relation to the climax (natural potential) plant community the area is
capable of supporting.

Forage -Browse and herbaceous foods that are available to grazing animals.

Grazing System -The manipulation of livestock grazing to accomplish a
desired result,

Land Treatments -Management actions to change the vegetative composition of

an area.

Management Framework Plan (MFP) -A BLM planning document that outlines
multiple use management objectives for an area,

Naturalness -Refers to an area which "generally appears to have been affected
primarily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work

•
Scoping Process -Public participation process used to identify issues and
alternatives to be addressed in the EIS.

Semi-Primitive Motorized Recreation -Motorized recreation activities
associated with primitive roads and two-wheel tracks in areas which are
otherwise natural or have minimal development.

Sensitive Species -Wildlife species which have been officially designated
by the BLM and state fish and game agencies through a Memorandum of
Understanding. They are species for which there is concern for their
continued existence. Although these species are not in as much jeopardy
as endangered or threatened species, further population or habitat '
declines may result in the more restrictive listing.

according to scenic quality, public sensitivity, and visibility for
major viewing points. Used to assess the visual impact of proposed
developments.

VRM Class I -Areas where natural ecological changes prevail. Changes in
the characteristic environment must not attract attention.

VRM Class II -Areas where new developments should not be evident in the
characteristic landscape.

VRM Class III -Areas where new developments may contrast with the landscape
but should remain subordinate to the landscape.

VRM Class IV -Areas where new developments may contrast with the landscape
but may attract attention and be a dominant feature of the landscape in
terms of scale; however, the change should repeat the basic elements.

Wilderness Study Area (WSA) -A roadless area that has been inventoried and
found to have wilderness characteristics as described in Section 603 of
FLPMA and Section 2(c) of the Wilderness Act of 1964.
